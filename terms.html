                        4.1 During the first connection with us, we will require all users to go through the
                        verification process in Sumsup. The verification process may vary depending on the amount of the
                        transaction you wish to conduct with us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For transactions under 1,000 euros, we request basic KYC verification. This includes providing a

                        4.2 In compliance with Act No. 253/2008 Sb. of the Czech Republic on Selected Measures against
                        the Legitimisation of Proceeds of Crime and Financing of Terrorism, we require all users to
                        undergo Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) checks. This includes

                        non-compliance, we are obligated to report such cases to the Financial Analytical Office (FAU)

                    <p>
                        The use of virtual currencies involves a high degree of risk. By using our services, you
                        acknowledge and agree to the following key risks, but not limited to:

                        Additionally, InstaDimes shall not be held liable for delays or failures to fulfill its
                        obligations caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to:
                        Natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, storms).
                        Technical failures (server issues, cyberattacks, power outages).
                        Government actions (regulatory changes, sanctions).
                        During such events, services may be suspended until the issue is resolved.
                        You are solely responsible for ensuring the security of your personal information, funds, and
                        transactions. InstaDimes shall not be liable for any losses resulting from:
                        Incorrect information provided by the user.
                        Unauthorized access due to user negligence (e.g., sharing sensitive information).
                        Market volatility or external disruptions.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Market Volatility: The value of virtual currencies can fluctuate significantly in a very
                            short
                            period. Users should be prepared for the possibility of substantial financial losses.</li>
                        <li> Security Risks: Virtual currencies are susceptible to hacking, fraud, and theft. Users
                            should
                            take appropriate measures to protect their personal information, funds, and private keys.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Regulatory Risks: Virtual currencies may face changing legal and regulatory environments in
                            different countries, potentially leading to restrictions, bans, or other legal consequences.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Liquidity Risks: Some virtual currencies may not be easily convertible into other
                            currencies, or
                            there may be limited options for trading them, particularly in times of market stress.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Technological Risks: The technology underlying virtual currencies, such as blockchain, is
                            complex and may be subject to bugs, security flaws, or vulnerabilities that could result in
                            financial loss.
